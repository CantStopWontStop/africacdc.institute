      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <p>Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) organisms are increasing globally, threatening to render existing treatments ineffective against many infectious diseases. In Africa, AMR has already been documented to be a problem for HIV and the pathogens that cause malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid, cholera, meningitis, gonorrhea, and dysentery. Recognizing the urgent need for action, the United Nations General Assembly approved a resolution in 2016 to ensure sustained and effective global action to address AMR, and three UN agencies—World Health Organization (WHO), Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and Food and Animal Organization—enacted global strategies for AMR control. Globally, drug resistance causes an estimated 700,000 human deaths each year, and, if current trends continue, AMR could result in over 10 million deaths per year and over 100 trillion USD in lost output globally by 2050. Coordinated action is needed across human, animal, and environmental sectors to delay emergence, limit transmission, and reduce harm from AMR organisms.  </p>
        <p>The primary goal of this course is to increase understanding  of policymakers in human health, animal health, and environment about the threat of AMR and effective approaches to control it. The course reviews the origin, burden, and consequences of antimicrobial resistance, the factors that drive development and transmission of resistance, approaches to diagnosis and treatment of resistant infections, and strategies to control resistance using a One Health approach. This training will help achieve one objective of Africa CDC’s Framework for AMR Control, specifically building human resources.</p>

            <p>Dr. Moore joined the BDI to become the Research Group Leader in May 2018, she leads the Oxford Global Burden of Disease (GBD) group on the Global Research on AntiMicrobial resistance (GRAM) project and works in partnership with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle to analyse global data to produce health metrics and geospatial maps on antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Utilising methodologies applied in IHME’s ongoing Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, the partnership is building global evidence on AMR with an initial focus on a select number of disease-resistant infections.</p>
